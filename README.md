Need to do: 
-figure out how to code a composite key (primary/foreign key)
-Allison: still need to do TV episodes - I think it's going to be too much though... wondering what kind of analysis we're going to do with TV Episodes table

Updates:
-took out TV_id and M_id from Profile
-V_id is the date
-Took out ratings b/c Netflix turned it into a thumbs up/down, percentage of match
